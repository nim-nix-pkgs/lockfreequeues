# lockfreequeues

Lock-free queues for Nim, implemented as ring buffers.

Three implementations are provided:

- [`Sipsic`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/sipsic.html) is a single-producer, single-consumer bounded queue. Pushing and popping are wait-free.
- [`Mupsic`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupsic.html) is a multi-producer, single-consumer bounded queue. Popping is wait-free.
- [`Mupmuc`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupmuc.html) is a multi-producer, multi-consumer bounded queue.

## Running tests

Tests can be run locally with `nimble test`.

CI runs the test suite for both C and C++ targets on Linux (`x86_64`, `armv7`, `aarch64`, `ppc64le`) and macOS (`x86_64`). The test suite is manually run on macOS `arm64`.

The test suite is also run with [LLVM thread sanitization](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html) to check for data races.
